### How to link form components to other components ###

1. Make sure to have <router-outlet></router-outlet> in the component that should change the visible content (here: our app.component.html)
2. for any link include `href="LINK_NAME" routerLink="/NAME_OF_COMPONENT" routerLinkActive="active" ariaCurrentWhenActive="page"` tags
3. In app-routing.module.ts add a path statement in the static route array: { path: `PATH`, component:COMPONENT_NAMEComponent}

A `PATH` consists of `/DESTINATION_COMPONENT` or `SOURCE_COMPONENT/DESTINATION_COMPONENT` for sub-pages
e.g., to link from component "foo" to component "baa" add `{ path: '/baa', component:BaaComponent}` or `{ path: 'foo/baa', component:BaaComponent}Â´ (for subpages) to the path array

If "baa" is nested in "baz". It needs a path entry like `{ path: 'foo/baz/baa', component:BaaComponent}`
